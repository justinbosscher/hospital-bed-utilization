## Project Objective
#### Hopefully, this project will predict bed utilization rates using Google Trends data. Currently, I am still looking for relevant hospital data.

## Methods
* Data Visualization
* Survival Analysis
* Kaplan-Meier Estimator
* Nelson-Aalen Estimator
* Log-Rank-Test
* Cox-Regression

## Technologies
* Python 3.8.1
* Python Virtual Environment
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python Packages
    * load_data
    * requests
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * KaplanMeierFitter
    * NelsonAalenFitter
    * logrank_test
    * CoxPHFitter
    * matplotlib

## Getting Started
1. If necessary, install the python3-venv package using the following command:
    sudo apt install python3.8-venv
2. Create virtual environment
    python3 -m venv hospitals-wkspc
3. cd into the folder created by running the last command.
4. Activate the environment:
    source bin/activate
5. pip install jupyter
6. pip3 install pytrends
6. pip install psycopg2-binary
6. pip install pandas
7. pip install numpy
8. pip install matplotlib.pyplot
9.
